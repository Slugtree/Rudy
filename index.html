            <h2>Who I am</h2>
                <p> My name is Rudy Huerta and I enjoy many things. I like gardening, playing games,
                    music, eating, and hanging out with friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first time I gardened I hated it, thought it was boring. After a looooong time, I started to enjoy it.
                    I would notice time to time the plants growing and it felt good to see something that I nurtured, 
                    well grow.
                </p>

                    I like playing a lot of games. I played my first video game when I was 8. My older sister
                    and brother were into games and they showed me super mario bros on our old rinky dinky tv.
                    I was mesmorized by it and have been stuck playing the for most of my life. Some games I
                    enjoy now and currently playing are <i>The Binding of Isaac</i>, <i> Terraria</i>, and 
                    <i>Repo</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I <strong>LOVE</strong> music. I enjoy hip-hop and rap the most. I also enjoy jazz, jazz-rap,
                    and some mellow low intensity music. My favorite artist hands down is MF Grimm. My personal favorite
                    song from him is "Life and Death". I also like listening to Nas, Tyler the Creator, Childish Gambino
                    Cuco, and Gorillaz. Some songs I'm currently listening to are, "WORTH." by KidTokio, "SASQUATCH" by Joshua Raw,
                    "MAYBACH" by Godard, and "Watch Say?" by CHROMA and A-Wall.

                    Places I've hanged out with friends are very limited but they are memorable. Such as, 
                    this one vr place (forgot the name), the mall, the <i>Habit</i>, and the soccer field.
                    There are other places but those are the most memorable.

                There was this one time where I almost got ran over by friend. We were on our way to store 
                to pick up somethings and before hand we went to eat at <i>Crumble Cookie</i>. I get car sick 
                easily after eating so I needed to get some air. He pulled over and I opened the door to get some air.
                He started driving while my hand was gripped on the door handle and I started getting dragged with the car.
                He went for a couple seconds and my foot almost got smooshed by the wheel.
