            <h2>Who I am</h2>
            <div id = "smallintro">
                <p> My name is Rudy Huerta and I am from California. My favorite food is banana bread and I
                    my favorite drink is Arizona Iced Tea. My favorite color is yellow and I like soccer. 
                     I like gardening, playing games, music, eating, and hanging out with friends.

                    The first time I gardened I thought it was really boring. After a while, I began to enjoy it.
                    I would notice from time to time the plants would grow. It felt good to see something that I nurtured grow
                    and flurish, until it didn't. I'm not the best gardener but I know how to take care of most plants.

                    This is a yellow rose, I dont really know the names of the plants but I do know this one blossomed real nice.
                    I really liked this one because my favorite color is yellow.

                        I like playing a lot of games. I played my first video game when I was 8. My older sister
                        and brother were into games and they showed me Super Mario Bros on our old tv. Some games I
                        enjoy now and currently playing are <i>The Binding of Isaac</i>, <i> Terraria</i>, and 
                        <i>Repo</i>. Playing games has helped me make a bunch of friends and it's something that has been heavily
                        integrated into my life.

                        I <strong>LOVE</strong> music, I enjoy hip-hop and rap the most. I also enjoy jazz, jazz-rap,
                        and some mellow low intensity music. My favorite artist hands down is MF Grimm. My personal favorite
                        song of his is "Life and Death". I also like listening to Nas, Tyler the Creator, Childish Gambino
                        Cuco, and Gorillaz. Some songs I'm currently listening to are, "WORTH." by KidTokio, "SASQUATCH" by Joshua Raw,
                        "MAYBACH" by Godard, and "Watch Say?" by CHROMA and A-Wall.

                        Places I've hanged out with friends are very limited but they are memorable. Such as, 
                        this one vr place, the mall, <i>The Habit</i>, and the soccer field.
                        There are other places but those are the most memorable.

                    There was this one time where I was almost ran over by friend. We were on our way to the drop off a friend,
                    before hand we went to eat at <i>Crumble Cookie</i>. I get car sick easily after eating so I needed to get 
                    some air. He pulled over and I opened the door to step out for a second.
                    He started driving while my hand was gripped on the door handle and I started getting dragged with the car.
                    He went for a couple seconds and my foot almost got smooshed by the wheel.
